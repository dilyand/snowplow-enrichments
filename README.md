## what3words reverse geocoding context

[what3words](https://what3words.com/) has divided the world into a grid of 3m x 3m squares and assigned each one a unique 3 word address. It means anyone can accurately find any location and share it quickly, easily and with little ambiguity.

The service can be used via the free mobile app or online map. It can also be built into any other app, platform or website, with just a few lines of code.

Better addressing can enhance customer experience, deliver business efficiency, drive growth and support social and economic development.

The service is especially useful in regions with less well developed postal and addressing systems.

The [reverse geocoding API](https://docs.what3words.com/api/v2/#reverse) resolves coordinates, expressed as latitude and longitude to a 3 word address.
